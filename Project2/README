CPRE 308 Project 2: Multithreaded Server

A multithreaded server that manages access to a set of bank accounts. The
program is started with a certain number of accounts in the bank, and user
requests can perform transactions on these accounts, as well as query their
current status. The number of accounts in the bank remains fixed through the
duration of the program.

Each request requires access to multiple records from a database, and also
requires some processing time. Since many user requests may arrive
simultaneously, servicing the requests sequentially, one after another, would
cause a high average latency for the users; servicing the requests in parallel
is required to keep response times small. Thus, this program uses multiple
threads to service the requests simultaneously.

User requests are presented via terminal window. When the user types in a
request, the server records the request and immediately presents the user with a
transaction ID, and then continues to accept more requests. At a later point in
time, when the request has been processed, the results will be written out. To 
avoid interfering with user input, the delayed responses will be written to a
file rather than displayed directly.
